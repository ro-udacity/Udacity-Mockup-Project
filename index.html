                    <br>I have been playing with web development since I was about 9 year old and tables were what all the cool kids used.
                    <br><br>I've worked in various IT jobs both web and non-web but have spent most of my adult life backpacking around the globe. I'm just back after about 3 years of travelling and haven't touched any 'work' for the entire time.
                    <br><br>I'm a bit out of the loop and self taught. I thought following a course like this might update me and fill in some of the basics I may have missed. </p>
